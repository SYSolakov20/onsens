## Introduction
### Summary of the project
The essence of this project was to create a C++ game based on Bool logic. In the game you can choose between four game modes, two of which have a special “NOT” card. We have created the application with a graphical interface for a more pleasant user experience. You can also enjoy various card packs on our hosted website.

### Where is it available?
Our collaborative work took place in GitHub and for the files to be accessible to everyone they were uploaded in the GitHub repository of our project.

### Communication?
Communication is realized trough Microsoft Teams. Thanks to all the features and the provided visualization – on-screen communication and feedback are sufficiently complete.

### What technologies are used?
The technologies that we used are Visual Studio 2019 as IDE, C++ as a programming language. Doxygen for documentation, Microsoft Word for Documentation. Microsoft Teams for communication, Microsoft PowerPoint for presentation, Git and GitHub for collaborative work.

## Method and manner of implementation
### Productive work
The tasks are defined in a way that everyone is aware of the tasks performed so far to present and answer quickly, clearly, and accurately, and teamwork is more efficient and productive.

### Distribution of tasks
For each task, a person is selected who is more familiar with the field and will be able to perform the task in the most competent way possible.

### Terms
Observance of dates was reminded by the Scrum Trainer. A meeting of the team is held every week to discuss the amount of time needed to complete the assigned task. Also we used a Milestone feature in GutHub to follow the work that everybody have done.
